    abstract = { This paper addresses the challenge to build an autonomous exploration system using Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). MAVs are capable of flying autonomously, generating collision-free paths to navigate in unknown areas and also reconstructing the environment at which they are deployed. One of the contributions of our system is the “3D-Sliced Planner” for exploration. The main innovation is the low computational resources needed. This is because Optimal-Frontier-Points (OFP) to explore are computed in 2D slices of the 3D environment using a global Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) frontier detector. Then, the MAV can plan path routes to these points to explore the surroundings with our new proposed local “FAST RRT* Planner” that uses a tree reconnection algorithm based on cost, and a collision checking algorithm based on Signed Distance Field (SDF). The results show the proposed explorer takes 43.95\% less time to compute exploration points and paths when compared with the State-of-the-Art represented by the Receding Horizon Next Best View Planner (RH-NBVP) in Gazebo simulations. }

ABSTRACT = {Collision-avoidance is a crucial research topic in robotics. Designing a collision-avoidance algorithm is still a challenging and open task, because of the requirements for navigating in unstructured and dynamic environments using limited payload and computing resources on board micro aerial vehicles. This article presents a novel depth-based collision-avoidance method for aerial robots, enabling high-speed flights in dynamic environments. First of all, a depth-based Euclidean distance field mapping algorithm is generated. Then, the proposed Euclidean distance field mapping strategy is integrated with a rapid-exploration random tree to construct a collision-avoidance system. The experimental results show that the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm has a robust performance at high flight speeds in challenging dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm can perform faster collision-avoidance maneuvers when compared to the state-of-art algorithms (the average computing time of the collision maneuver is 25.4 ms, while the minimum computing time is 10.4 ms). The average computing time is six times faster than one baseline algorithm. Additionally, fully autonomous flight experiments are also conducted for validating the presented collision-avoidance approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial robots are widely used in search and rescue applications because of their small size and high maneuvering. However, designing an autonomous exploration algorithm is still a challenging and open task, because of the limited payload and computing resources on board UAVs. This paper presents an autonomous exploration algorithm for the aerial robots that shows several improvements for being used in the search and rescue tasks. First of all, an RGB-D sensor is used to receive information from the environment and the OctoMap divides the environment into obstacles, free and unknown spaces. Then, a clustering algorithm is used to filter the frontiers extracted from the OctoMap, and an information gain based cost function is applied to choose the optimal frontier. At last, the feasible path is given by A* path planner and a safe corridor generation algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been tested and compared with baseline algorithms in three different environments with the map resolutions of 0.2 m, and 0.3 m. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a shorter exploration path and can save more exploration time when compared with the state of the art. The algorithm has also been validated in the real flight experiments.},

    abstract = { This paper presents a novel collision-free navigation system for the unmanned aerial vehicle based on point clouds that outperform compared to baseline methods, enabling high-speed flights in cluttered environments, such as forests or many indoor industrial plants. The algorithm takes the point cloud information from physical sensors (e.g. lidar, depth camera) and then converts it to an occupied map using Voxblox, which is then used by a rapid-exploring random tree to generate finite path candidates. A modified Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning objective function is used to select the best candidate and update it. Finally, the best candidate trajectory is generated and sent to a Model Predictive Control controller. The proposed navigation strategy is evaluated in four different simulation environments; the results show that the proposed method has a better success rate and a shorter goal-reaching distance than the baseline method. }

abstract="This paper proposed a dynamic RRT algorithm that applied to fixed-wing UAV's path planning in dynamic three-dimensional environment. The tree structure of the dynamic RRT algorithm was expanded by adopting the constraint equations to satisfy fixed-wing UAV's actual dynamic constrains. In order to avoid collision with dynamic obstacles, corresponding locations of dynamic obstacles in the time of each step are considered in the algorithm. Also, B-spline was also used to interpolate the resulting optimal path for fixed-wing UAV. As a result, the algorithm could generate a smooth path that satisfy UAV's dynamic constrains in the three-dimensional environment with static and/or dynamic obstacles. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of proposed dynamic RRT algorithm, indicating that it could be applied to fixed-wing UAV's path planning in dynamic three-dimensional environment.",
